        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm a student at the University of Rhode Island. I am currently majoring in History with a trajectory to graduate in 2025. This is my programming portfolio for my class: CSC 106. This is the first time I've ever coded something. I went to Exeter-West Greenwich Regional High School and graduated with an Art Pathway certification. My hobbies are: drawing and painting, reading, writing reviews, watching films, sculpture, photography, and collecting media such as CDs and cassettes. My favorite bands and musicians are the following: Talking Heads, They Might Be Giants, Tom Waits, Fiona Apple, The Beach Boys, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Garbage, Slowdive, and The Dead Kennedys.</p>
